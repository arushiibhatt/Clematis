<!-- Training Programs -->
 <!-- Think Like a Physicist-->
  <p id="physicist-text">We have launched the Think Like a Physicist‚ÄîClematis Training Program, a hands-on introduction to physics 
    research led by PhD students from the University of Sydney and the University of Oxford! Over four engaging journal club sessions, 
    we explored distinct areas of physics: optical physics, biophysics, astroparticle physics, and photonics/plasmonics. Each session 
    offered an opportunity to dive into cutting-edge research papers, discuss complex concepts, and connect with a community of budding 
    physicists. We have recorded the sessions from which you can watch on our YouTube. Those who attend all four sessions, either live 
    or asynchronously, and complete the required assignments via Discord will receive a certificate recognizing their participation and 
    effort. üåå ‚öõÔ∏è </p>

    <!-- Post-Session Activities -->
    <p id="post-session-text">Post-session reflection questions have been shared on our Discord channel: #general-writing-practice. 
    These are designed to encourage critical thinking and spark ongoing conversations. We‚Äôll be using Discord to continue discussions 
    from the session, and the instructor will be available there to answer any questions and engage with you. We‚Äôd love to see your 
    thoughts and ideas‚Äîlet‚Äôs keep the conversation alive! Instructions on using Discord and engaging in our post-session activities 
    were explained in our recorded session</p>

    <!-- Clematis Physics Trainee Award -->
    <p id="trainee-award-text">Each session, we may recognize participants who show exceptional curiosity, enthusiasm, and engagement 
    with the Clematis Training Program activities. This includes participation both during the session and in the post-session 
    discussions. For more details, please watch this recording section</p>

    <!-- Certificate of Completion -->
    <p id="certificate1-text">Participants who engage with all sessions‚Äîwhether live or via recordings‚Äîand complete the assignments will 
    receive a certificate recognizing their effort and commitment.</p>
    <p id="certificate2-text">Note, as long as you review the materials, including YouTube recordings, and complete the assignments for 
    all sessions, even if done out of order, you will be eligible to receive the certificate of completion. The core value lies in 
    fostering your learning, growth in research skills, and critical thinking throughout the process.</p>

<!--Sessions-->
<!-- Session 1: Optical Physics -->
<p id="optical-intro-text">This hands-on introduction to optical physics was led by Libertad Rojas, a PhD Student at the University of Sydney. Her session took us through the mindset of optical physicists while guiding us through the fascinating insights of Masullo et al. (2022) and their groundbreaking work on RASTMIN‚Äîa single-molecule localization microscopy technique achieving ~1‚Äì2 nanometer localization precision.</p>
<p id="optical-assignment-text">The assignment / reflection question can be found on our Clematis Discord.</p>

<!-- Session 2: Biophysics -->
<p id="biophysics-intro-text">In this session, led by a PhD researcher at the University of Oxford, we discover how principles of thermodynamics are used to quantify and explain how billions of neurons compute efficiently, how information is transferred within the brain, and how our brain organizes itself as a hierarchical system. Together, we dissect and explore cutting-edge research in the field of biophysics.</p>
<p id="biophysics-research-text">We referred to the primary paper that used transfer entropy to understand the brain‚Äôs hierarchical organization (Deco et al., 2021) and the review paper on the Thermodynamics of Mind (Kringelbach et al., 2024).</p>
<p id="biophysics-assignment-text">The assignment / reflection question can be found on our Clematis Discord.</p>

<!-- Session 3: Astroparticle Physics -->
<p id="astroparticle-intro-text">‚ÄúJust because you haven‚Äôt seen it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù ‚Äî The Santa Clause (1994). This quote perfectly captures one of the key themes of this session: Dark Matter. We explored one of the most outstanding problems in physics‚Äîthe search for the invisible particles that make up 27% of our universe.</p>
<p id="astroparticle-learning-text">We learned from a hands-on introduction to Astroparticle Physics, led by a PhD researcher from the University of Sydney who previously worked with the research team at SNOLAB, Canada‚Äôs underground science lab specializing in neutrino and dark matter physics.</p>
<p id="astroparticle-research-text">We dove deep into astroparticle physics, referring to publications on heavy dark matter detection and Super Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (SuperCDMS).</p>
<p id="astroparticle-assignment-text">The assignment / reflection question can be found on our Clematis Discord.</p>

<!-- Session 4: Photonics and Plasmonics -->
<p id="photonics-intro-text">We learned from a hands-on introduction to Photonics and Plasmonics, exploring how to enhance nonlinear light-matter interactions using nanoscale photonic and plasmonic structures. The session was led by Libertad Rojas, a PhD student at the University of Sydney, whose research focuses on developing a new class of efficient plasmonic and nanophotonic devices.</p>
<p id="photonics-research-text">We discussed techniques for enhancing nonlinear light-matter interactions at the nanoscale and referred to the scientific paper "Fundamental Limitations to the Ultimate Kerr Nonlinear Performance of Plasmonic Waveguides".</p>
