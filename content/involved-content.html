<!-- Volunteer Overview -->
<p id="volunteer">Clematis thrives on people who are proactive, passionate, and self-directed. If you love turning ideas into action—and 
    you care about making high-quality research and learning accessible—you’ll fit right in. Here, you decide how to contribute: 
    outreach, communications, web stewardship, event hosting, resource design, fundraising, or something entirely new. As long as your 
    effort advances our mission to empower the next generation of researchers and changemakers, we’ll give you the guidance and freedom 
    to run with it.</p>

<!-- Outreach Team -->
<p id="outreach">Help Clematis reach new corners of the world. You’ll share our workshops, competitions, and scholarship calls with 
    schools, clubs, and community organizations. Depending on how you like to outreach, you could craft outreach emails, present at 
    student clubs, and forge partnerships with educators who might request a custom training session. Ideal for those who enjoy 
    building relationships and amplifying opportunities.</p>

<!-- Communications -->
<p id="communications">Turn our dynamic community into compelling stories. You might spotlight member successes on social media, 
    design infographics that demystify research, or manage campaigns that grow our Discord and newsletter audiences. We also love 
    for you to join if you like creating trend-based social media content to make science accessible. If you have a knack for content 
    creation, branding, or community management, and a passion for making science approachable, his role is for you.</p>

<!-- Pedagogical Team -->
<p id="pedagogy">Design resources that make authentic research doable in any classroom. Under the mentorship of our Founder and 
    faculty partners, you’ll create lesson templates, inquiry-based assignments, and workshop modules adaptable to diverse curricula. 
    We welcome fresh ideas, whether it’s a statistics mini-course, a qualitative-methods guide, or a new student challenge.</p>

<!-- Webmaster -->
<p id="webmaster">Keep clematisresearch.org fast, clear, and beautiful. You’ll maintain pages, troubleshoot bugs, and implement new 
    features.</p>

<!-- Partnerships & Fundraising -->
<p id="fundraising">Secure the resources that power our programs. You’ll research prospective sponsors, craft pitch decks, and manage 
    relationships with foundations, companies, and individual donors. If you enjoy strategic outreach and storytelling with measurable 
    impact, join us in scaling Clematis’s reach.</p>

<!-- Academic Ambassadors -->
<p id="ambassadors">Are you a graduate student with deep research expertise and a passion for outreach? As an Academic Ambassador, 
    you’ll spearhead advanced learning experiences for the Clematis community—designing workshops, competitions, and speaker events 
    that translate cutting-edge scholarship into inspiring, hands-on opportunities for younger learners. Ambassadors may also leverage 
    their networks to recruit guest scientists and panelists, shaping content that spans disciplines.</p>

<p id="ambassadors-examples">Recent examples include Libertad Rojas (Academic Ambassador — Physics), who led our Think Like a Physicist 
    session, and Aarushi Vardhan (Academic Ambassador — Biological Sciences), who has delivered multiple research seminars in her field 
    and co-chaired the launch of the 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition. If you’re eager to lead intellectually rigorous 
    programming and mentor the next generation of researchers, we’d love to collaborate.</p>

<!-- Research Mentor -->
<p id="research-mentor">Many private companies now charge substantial fees—ranging from $500 to $13,000—for research and leadership 
    xperiences, presenting them as essential for college preparation or career advancement.</p>

<p id="mentor-mission">Our mission is to break barriers to research opportunities, which is crucial for addressing educational 
    disparities that often limit the potential of talented students, particularly those from underrepresented or economically 
    disadvantaged backgrounds.</p>

<p id="mentor-projects">To achieve this goal, Clematis proudly partners with Professor Steve Joordens and the Advanced Learning 
    Technologies Lab at the University of Toronto to offer real, authentic research projects across 10+ disciplines to any interested 
    research enthusiasts for free!</p>

<p id="mentor-call">We are calling graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, professors, and researchers to design a research project 
    that will allow any students, regardless of their skill level or background, to be involved in your research fields!</p>

<p id="mentor-history">In the past, our hands-on research projects have involved literature and systematic reviews, or leveraged 
    open-source datasets for motivated high school students to learn statistics and tackle meaningful research questions.</p>

<p id="mentor-contact">Whether you have a fully-formed idea, or you want to work with us to design a feasible project for high school 
    student(s) that you can mentor, please email Sapolnach: sapolnach.prompiengchai@psych.ox.ac.uk</p>

<!-- Catalyst Mentors -->
<p id="catalyst-intro">We must invest in empowering young people who have the vision, drive, and courage to shape a better future. 
    We have launched Clematis Catalyst Scholars Program, a six-month mentorship program that empowers exceptional high school students 
    to bring their ideas to life. Catalyst Scholars may be invited to apply for financial support up to CAD $500 to scale their ideas.</p>

<p id="catalyst-invite">If you are a student leader and changemaker, we invite you to become one of the peer or senior mentors in our 
    multi-tiered mentorship models!</p>

<p id="catalyst-peer">An accomplished undergraduate who will be the mentee’s sounding board and guide. Commitment is meeting once a 
    month for six months.</p>

<p id="catalyst-senior">An exceptional graduate student leader (or recent grads) who will provide specialized expertise and advice. 
    Commitment is meeting bimonthly for six months.</p>

<p id="catalyst-advisor">As Catalyst Scholars advance through the program, Catalyst Scholars and their mentors may have the opportunity 
    to meet with advisors—esteemed scientists, leaders, founders, and professionals. We hope that meeting the advisor will be a 
    life-changing experience for many young scholars.</p>

<p id="catalyst-process">If you decide to become a prospective Catalyst mentor, we may invite you to help review applications for the 
    prospective Catalyst Scholars.</p>

<p id="catalyst-selection">Our first priority is to match each student with a mentor whose expertise and working style align with the 
    project goals. Before any pairing is finalized, you’ll receive the prospective Scholar’s proposal and can confirm whether the match 
    feels right. Once you agree, we ask that you support your Scholar for the full six-month programme.</p>

<!-- Catalyst Advisors -->

    expertise and accomplishments in their respective fields, dedicated to shaping the next generation of leaders committed to

    Catalyst Scholars Program. As our scholars progress, they may have the opportunity to meet with one of our advisors for 
    personalized guidance and support, helping them navigate their projects.</p>

    aimed at making a meaningful impact in their community.</p>

<p id="advisor-meeting">As an advisor, your commitment will be a one-time online meeting with one of our Catalyst scholars 
    (and their project mentors who are accomplished undergraduate and graduate student leaders).</p>

<p id="advisor-coordination">To help accommodate your schedule, we will coordinate with you well in advance to find a time that 
    works for you. In addition, we will share applicant materials and project proposals/reports for your consideration. While we 
    will plan ahead, you are also welcome to opt in or out based on your schedule and the applicant’s materials. Since applications 
    are reviewed on a rolling basis, this structure allows you to participate in a way that best fits your interests and availability.</p>
