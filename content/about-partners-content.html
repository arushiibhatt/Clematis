 <p id="partners-text">Since its founding, Clematis has partnered with diverse stakeholders within the secondary and tertiary 
    educational systems to empower students by providing access to mentorship, hands-on research opportunities, and skill-building 
    initiatives, cultivating the next generation of leaders, innovators, and researchers dedicated to driving innovation and 
    creating meaningful, lasting change.  </p>

<!-- Research and Teaching Partners Text -->
 <p id="res-teach-text">We work with professors, researchers, psychologists, and graduate student researchers to make cutting-edge 
    research tools and methodologies accessible to high school and undergraduate students. Furthermore, we collaborate with lecturers 
    and teachers, along with our pedagogical experts, to foster research skills in real-world classrooms. </p>

<!-- Prof Steve Joordens -->
 <p id="joordens-p1">Steve Joordens is a Professor of Psychology at the University of Toronto and has served as the Director of the 
    Advanced Learning Technologies Lab for over 30 years. Initially trained as a cognitive psychologist specializing in human 
    memory and consciousness, his research has since evolved to focus on the effective use of educational technologies—particularly 
    those that support the development of core "Skills of Success," such as critical and creative thinking, effective communication 
    and collaboration, and metacognitive awareness. His lab operates at the intersection of pedagogy, psychology, and artificial 
    intelligence. </p>

 <p id="joordens-p2">A passionate advocate for open education, Dr. Joordens developed massive open online courses (MOOC) on Coursera, 
    which have now enrolled over 700,000 students! The first course was a part of a $100,000 grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates 
    Foundation. Furthermore, his outstanding contributions to teaching have earned him numerous accolades, including the Leadership 
    in Faculty Teaching Award, the President's Teaching Award, the 3M National Teaching Fellowship, and, most recently, the Canadian 
    Post-Secondary EdTech Leader of the Year Award from Mindshare Learning. One of the educational technologies he co-developed with 
    his PhD student, peerScholar, won the 2009 National Technology Innovation Award and is now a commercial product used in schools 
    and universities worldwide. </p>

<!-- Gruntman Lab -->
 <p id="gruntman-p1">Prof. Eyal Gruntman’s lab in the Department of Cell & Systems Biology at the University of Toronto studies how 
    the brain extracts visual information to guide behavior, using the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster as a powerful model organism. 
    Although flies perceive the world differently than humans, they still rely heavily on vision to perform complex tasks such as 
    finding mates, avoiding predators, and navigating through their environments. These tasks demand visual computations that are fast, 
    robust, and efficient—performed with just ~100,000 neurons. </p>

 <p id="gruntman-p1">The Gruntman lab aims to understand how visual circuits carry out these fundamental computations and how the brain 
    assembles complex percepts from elementary visual features. These processes begin in the retina, where basic object recognition and 
    motion detection occur even before visual information reaches the brain. By combining electrophysiology, imaging, behavioral 
    experiments, and connectomics analysis—including the use of complete electron microscopy datasets—alongside modern Drosophila 
    genetic tools, the lab investigates single-neuron computations in the context of brain-wide networks. Through this work, the lab 
    seeks to uncover fundamental principles of visual processing.  </p>

<!-- Anreiter Lab -->
 <p id="anreiter-p1">Given that every individual differs in how they or their body responds to an experience, Prof. Ina Anreiter’s lab 
    in the Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto is interested in understanding where these 
    differences originate from at the biological level. Every individual is born with a fixed set of genes but the activity of those 
    genes (e.g., their expression) can change in response to experience (e.g., stress, past and current environment). To understand 
    what makes individuals behave differently, the Anreiter lab looks at genes with specific functions in development and behavior 
    and how their expression is regulated.  </p>

  <p id="anreiter-p2">Our work tries to explain the molecular pathways through which the environment interacts with genes, the long-term 
    effects of these interactions, and differences between individuals. To answer these questions, we use the fruit fly (Drosophila 
    melanogaster) as a model organism to study processes of gene regulation that influence development, physiology, and behavior. A 
    particular focus of our lab lies in behavioral epigenetics and epitranscriptomics, or the deposition of chemical marks on DNA, 
    histones, and RNA. Our work combines classical genetics, molecular biology, transcriptomics, behavioral assays, and bioinformatics. </p>

<!-- Prof. Svetlana (Lana) Mikhaylichenko -->
 <p id="lana-text">Prof. Lana Mikhaylichenko is currently a Full Professor, Teaching Stream, at the Department of Physical and 
    Environmental Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough. She served as Associate Chair, Undergraduate from 2016 to 2021. 
    Her research interests include the chemistry of pyridine and high-swelling hydrogels. Throughout her tenure at UTSC, Dr. 
    Mikhaylichenko has taught a range of undergraduate courses including first-year chemistry courses, higher-level organic and 
    bio-organic chemistry, and biochemistry. She is the recipient of the University of Toronto Scarborough Outstanding Teaching Award 
    (2014), the UTSC D.R. Campbell Merit Award (2008), and numerous University of Toronto Scarborough Dean’s Merit Excellence Awards. 
    Dr. Mikhaylichenko is also a passionate chemistry outreach enthusiast, serving the Toronto community as a member of the Toronto 
    Science Fair executive committee since 2010. </p>
