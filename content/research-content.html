 <p id="research-text">Financial, attitudinal, and systemic obstacles restrict many students from accessing research opportunities that 
    foster inquiry-based learning, mentorship, and essential skills. Our mission is to break barriers to research opportunities for 
    young people.  </p>

<!-- Research Projects -->
 <p id="project-text">We partner with professors and graduate student researchers from the University of Toronto and the University of 
    Oxford to offer real, authentic research projects across 10+ disciplines to over 100+ research enthusiasts for free.</p>

<!-- Integrating into Classrooms -->
 <p id="classrooms-text">We partner with Prof. Steve Joordens at the University of Toronto and Advanced Learning Technologies Lab to 
    employ cutting-edge, evidence-based pedagogical techniques to foster inquiry-based, research-based learning into real-world 
    classrooms.</p>

<!-- Research Competition -->
  <p id="competition-text">We make cutting-edge research tools accessible to students through research competitions! 
    In May 2025, we launched the 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition in partnership with Profs. Eyal Gruntman’s 
    and Ina Anreiter’s laboratories at UofT. High school and undergraduate students gained hands-on research experience 
    in using cutting-edge computational neuroscience tools to explore a recently-released, large-scale brain dataset 
    while competing for CAD $500 in total prizes.</p>
