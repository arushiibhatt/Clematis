<!-- Inquiry-Based and Authentic Learning -->
<p id="inquiry-intro">Incorporating research-oriented learning into classroom teaching fosters not only content mastery but also a 
    suite of critical academic and professional competencies. It’s known that engaging students in inquiry-based learning cultivates 
    intellectual curiosity, metacognitive awareness, and critical thinking. When students take ownership of knowledge creation through 
    research-based learning, rather than passively consuming information, they become lifelong learners and develop skills in 
    formulating research questions, synthesizing evidence, evaluating sources, and communicating complex ideas. Such research skills 
    are transferable to their future careers.</p>
<p id="authentic-intro">Furthermore, we believe that authentic learning, in which student outputs are shared beyond the classroom, 
    strengthens motivation and relevance. By contributing to peer communities or presenting their work publicly in a safe space, 
    students gain confidence, receive meaningful feedback, and begin to see themselves as knowledge producers. Embedding such practices 
    within existing curricula enhances engagement, deepens understanding, and nurtures transferable skills such as communication, 
    creativity, and collaboration.</p>

<!-- How Clematis Supports Educators -->
<p id="clematis-support">At Clematis, we work alongside educators in secondary and tertiary education to embed research into the 
    curriculum in ways that are flexible, scalable, and pedagogically sound. Our team has collaborated with faculty and teachers 
    across institutions to co-design assignments and interventions that foster research skills while aligning with course objectives 
    and classroom realities.</p>

<!-- Community-Integrated Learning Assignments -->
<p id="assignments-templates">We offer ready-to-use templates for community-integrated assignments that foster research skills and 
    inquiry-based learning within your classroom. We work with you to tailor the assignments to your classroom, and we will ensure 
    that they are administratively very easy to run. For example, students might create a research infographic translating a scientific 
    concept they’ve learned into a format accessible to the public. These outputs are then shared within our Clematis network of over 
    800 global learners via Discord, creating authentic peer-to-peer dissemination and feedback opportunities. Your students will be 
    very familiar with Discord, as it has over 200+ million active monthly users. Discord has a strict teen and child policy, including 
    zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and algorithmic measures to detect novel forms of CSAM. Our Clematis community also places an additional safeguard via 24/7 human moderation.</p>
<p id="assignments-flexibility">There are different ways to incorporate these assignments within your classrooms, depending on your 
    context. In the past, educators have often incorporated these assignments as optional “bonus” or “extra credit” activities, 
    particularly at the undergraduate level, providing students with a low-stakes opportunity to engage deeply while preserving 
    flexibility within the syllabus. Clematis has successfully supported over 2,500 students through our community-integrated learning 
    assignments. We have successfully introduced them to both small-sized and large-sized classrooms (e.g., 500+ students).</p>
<p id="assignments-outcomes">Many students have used their final deliverables to apply for research positions, and in some cases, 
    to secure letters of recommendation from their instructors who were impressed by the quality of work. For classes seeking an 
    added layer of recognition, we also offer optional peer-review panels or external judging to highlight the top submissions 
    (e.g., top 10 or top 3). Often, the judges, who are graduate students and professors, offer to meet with the winning research work. 
    This is up to the instructor.</p>
<p id="assignments-collab">Above all, we are eager to collaborate with you to adapt or design assignments that fit your specific 
    teaching goals, discipline, and classroom environment. These assignments have been developed in consultation with faculty partners 
    and student advisors who are high school and undergraduate students. We have adapted and improved based on our educator’s feedback. 
    We also recognize that each educational context is different, and the goal of all our initiatives is to ensure that they are easy 
    to implement while fostering meaningful pedagogical outcomes.</p>

<!-- Guest Lecturers -->
<p id="guest-intro">For educators seeking to motivate students and connect classroom content to real-world applications, 
    Clematis offers a guest speaker initiative. Instructors can request a live session or recorded talk by scientists or researchers 
    working in fields related to their course curriculum—whether it’s physics, chemistry, biology, psychology, social sciences, 
    AI, and beyond.</p>
<p id="guest-benefit">These sessions not only enhance subject matter understanding but also serve as bridges between secondary and 
    post-secondary learning, exposing students to research trajectories and careers early on. By contextualizing core concepts through 
    active researchers, students are more likely to perceive science as dynamic, relevant, and accessible.</p>

    We’re happy to help you create experiences that inspire your students and enrich your classroom!</p>
