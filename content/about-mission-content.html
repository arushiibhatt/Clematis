<!-- Mission -->
<p id="mission-p1">Young people are energetic, empathetic, and full of bold ideas. They care deeply about the world around them 
    and bring a unique creativity and sense of purpose to todayâ€™s most pressing challenges. With the right support, every student 
    has the potential to lead meaningful change. We believe that nurturing this potential early on doesn't just benefit the 
    students themselves; it sparks ideas and action that ripple outward into families, schools, and communities. </p>
<p id="mission-p2">At Clematis, we empower the next generation of changemakers through research and leadership programs that make 
    cutting-edge learning accessible, exciting, and impactful. By providing high school students with authentic research experiences, 
    dedicated mentorship, and skills to implement their ideas, we help them grow into thinkers and leaders who inspire others. 
    When young people are trusted with real opportunities, their impact reaches far beyond a single project or classroom. 
    They become catalysts for a more thoughtful, innovative, and equitable future. </p>

<!-- Story -->
 <p id="story-p1">Our Founder, <strong>Sapolnach Prompiengchai</strong>, is the first Global Rhodes Scholar from Thailand at the University of Oxford 
    and a full-ride Pearson scholar alum at the University of Toronto. Through his research spanning wide-ranging disciplines, 
    including neuroscience, mental health, education, and environmental chemistry, he realized how research, diverse perspectives, 
    mentorship, and a tight-knit community have empowered him to make a difference in a way that is meaningful to him, his community, 
    and the world. </p>
<p id="story-p2">Throughout his academic journey, he has witnessed firsthand systemic barriers that limit access to high-quality 
    research and mentorship opportunities, particularly for young aspiring scientists and changemakers. This may include financial, 
    attitudinal, cultural, and other systemic barriers. Among his many research interests, he has closely collaborated with <strong>Prof. 
    Steve Joordens</strong>, an expert in educational psychology at the University of Toronto, to tackle pressing challenges in the world of 
    education for almost half a decade now. With their long-term partnership and extensive experience in academia, Clematis was 
    conceptualized to make research and leadership opportunities accessible at scale, empowering the next generation of leaders and 
    innovators.  </p>
