<!-- Hero Section -->
<p id="hero-text">Young people have the vision, energy, and empathy to tackle society’s toughest problems. 
  Through our flagship research and leadership programs, we equip them with resources and mentorship to become 
  thinkers and leaders who will inspire change in their communities and beyond.</p>

<!-- Mission -->
<p id="mission-text">Our Mission is to break barriers to research and leadership opportunities for young people.</p>

<!-- Community Blurb -->
 <p id="community-text">Clematis Research Empowerment Hub is a tight-knit, interdisciplinary community of students, learners, 
  researchers, and everyone interested in research and leadership. We strive to inspire our community members to harness the 
  power of research and learning, transforming their passion into meaningful, positive impacts on their communities.  </p>

<!-- Empowering Research -->
 <p id="research-text">Financial, attitudinal, and systemic obstacles restrict many students from accessing research opportunities 
  that foster inquiry-based learning, mentorship, and essential skills.   </p>

 <p id="research-project-text">We partner with professors and graduate student researchers from the University of Toronto and 
  the University of Oxford to offer real, authentic research projects across 10+ disciplines to over 100+ research enthusiasts 
  for free.</p>

 <p id="research-classrooms-text">We partner with Prof. Steve Joordens at the University of Toronto and Advanced Learning Technologies 
  Lab to employ cutting-edge, evidence-based pedagogical techniques to foster inquiry-based, research-based learning into 
  real-world classrooms.</p>

 <p id="research-competition-text">We make cutting-edge research tools accessible to students through research competitions! 
  In May 2025, we launched the 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition in partnership with Profs. Eyal Gruntman’s and 
  Ina Anreiter’s laboratories at UofT. High school and undergraduate students gained hands-on research experience in using 
  cutting-edge computational neuroscience tools to explore a recently-released, large-scale brain dataset while competing for 
  CAD $500 in total prizes.</p>

<!-- Empowering Leadership -->
 <p id="leadership-text">We must invest in empowering young people who have the vision, drive, and courage to shape a better future. 
  Thus, we have launched the Clematis Catalyst Scholars Program to empower high school students with promising, impactful ideas for 
  society by providing mentorship to help bring these ideas to life.    </p>

 <p id="leadership-mentorship-text">Catalyst Scholars will work closely with Clematis’ mentors and advisors from diverse 
  backgrounds. They are affiliated with institutions around the world, including Europe (e.g., University of Oxford, 
  University of Cambridge, Rhodes Trust, and Schmidt Science Fellows), North America (e.g., University of Toronto, 
  Harvard University, UC Berkeley, Princeton University) Africa (e.g., Covenant University), and additional institutions 
  worldwide. </p>

 <p id="leadership-development-text">Catalyst Scholars will receive structured support, including check-ins and progress 
  reports, from the Clematis Team. They will get an opportunity to showcase their work and attend talks from our 
  distinguished mentors and advisors.  </p>

 <p id="leadership-financial-text">Catalyst Scholars may get an opportunity to apply for our Catalyst Grant, aimed to 
  support impactful projects led by high school students, with budgets of up to CAD $250-$500 for each project.  </p>
