 <p id="header-text">ðŸ§  What if high school and undergraduate students could step directly into the world of cutting-edge neuroscience? </p>

 <p id="head-p1">We are excited to launch the 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition, the first international competition of its 
    kind, designed to introduce high school and undergraduate students to the cutting-edge world of connectomics and neuroscience 
    research withâ€¯CAD $500â€¯in total prizes.  </p>
 <p id="head-p2">In partnership with Profs.â€¯Gruntman'sâ€¯andâ€¯Anreiter'sâ€¯Labs at the University of Toronto,â€¯weâ€™re thrilled to invite 
    students on a fun-filled journey into neuroscience, where you'll get hands-on research experience with anâ€¯open-source, 
    large-scale brain dataset, guided by supportive, knowledgeable instructors throughout the research competition. Whether 
    you're new to neuroscience or already curious about the brain, this is your chance to dive in, explore, and discover!</p>

<!-- Eligibility Criteria -->
 <p id="prize-text">The 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition is open to students worldwide and will feature two prize categories:</p>

 <p id="hs-text">For students who, at the time of submission, are currently enrolled in high school or on a gap year and have not 
    yet begun post-secondary studies.</p>
 <p id="uni-text">For students who, at the time of submission, are currently enrolled in a post-secondary institution (e.g., 
    college or university) and have not yet graduated. Those who are doing medicine (e.g., MBBS) as their first university degree 
    is also eligible.</p>

<!-- Awards -->
 <p id="money-text">A total of CAD $500 in prize money will be awarded across two categories: </p>

<!-- What would you be researching? -->
 <p id="explore-text">You will be exploring a large-scale fruit fly (Drosophila Melanagestor) brain dataset, which we call such 
    brain map, a connectome. Connectomics is one of the cutting-edge fields revolutionizing our understanding of the brain, 
    and the fruit fly has been a very powerful animal model enabling us to reveal new insights about the brain.</p>

<p id="tools-text">You will use cutting-edge connectomics tools, Neuroglancer (for structural visualization) and neuPrint 
    (for connectivity analysis), that experimental and computational neuroscientists would typically use in their research. 
    <b>No programming experience is required.</b></p>

<p id="task1-text">You will choose a neuron of interest from this fruit fly optic lobe connectome (brain map) using Neuroglancer. 
    You might pick one based on its shape, location, or connectionsâ€”or simply because it looks cool! </p>
<p id="task2-text">You will visualize the neuron's structure using Neuroglancer.  This will help you understand its morphologyâ€”how 
    it branches, where it travels, and what visual regions it is in. </p>
<p id="task3-text">You will investigate the scientific literature to find out whatâ€™s currently known about your chosen neuron. 
    Has it been studied before? Is it part of a known visual circuit? What kinds of behaviors has it been linked to? </p>
<p id="task4-text">You will propose how the structure might relate to function or behavior (or not at all). In your report, youâ€™ll 
    bring together what you learned from your literature review and your observations of the neuronâ€™s structure in the connectome. 
    Think about what this neuron might do, and whether seeing its structure in 3D gave you any new insights. </p>
<p id="task5-text">You will explore upstream and downstream connections using neuPrint. Seeing what kinds of neurons send input to 
    your neuron, and which neurons it connects to, can help you place it in the context of a larger circuit. This may help you gain 
    even better insights about its role in vision or behavior.</p>

<!-- Submission -->
 <p id="community-text">A creative submission of your research using the connectomic (brain) dataset!</p>

 <p id="res-text">A 500-1000 word formal research report of your research project.</p>

<!-- Submission Criteria -->
 <p id="bio1-text">Shows depth of understanding about the selected neuron(s). </p>
 <p id="bio2-text">Draws meaningful connections between neuronal structure and possible function or behavior through literature 
    review and/or observations from the connectome. Integrates scientific literature and connectome observations to build a 
    compelling narrative about the neuron of interest.</p>
 <p id="bio2-text">Integrates scientific literature and connectome observations to build a compelling narrative about the 
    neuron of interest.</p>
 <p id="bio4-text">Demonstrates curiosity and the ability to explore how the neuron fits into broader brain systems or known behaviors, 
    using evidence and reasoning from multiple sources (e.g., research papers, connectome, and principles of neuroscience/biology). </p>

 <p id="engage1-text">Demonstrates thoughtful and effective use of connectomics tools (Neuroglancer and neuPrint) to investigate neural 
    structure and connectivity, using these insights to support both the scientific exploration and communication of findings across 
    the Discord and formal report submission. </p>
 <p id="engage2-text">Screenshots, figures, or visual documentation are used meaningfully to highlight findings.</p>
 <p id="engage3-text">Shows appreciation for how large-scale connectomic data can add neurobiological insights.</p>

 <p id="comm1-text">Written report is clear, well-structured, and communicates ideas effectively.</p>
 <p id="comm2-text">Discord presentation is accessible, engaging, and appropriate for a peer-student audience.</p>
 <p id="comm3-text">Uses scientific terminology appropriately, with clear explanations when needed</p>

 <p id="learn1-text">Shows evidence of genuine learning and exploration.</p>
 <p id="learn2-text">Reflects on challenges, surprises, or new understandings gained through the process.</p>
 <p id="learn3-text">Makes clear how their thinking evolvedâ€”from neuron selection to final interpretation.</p>
