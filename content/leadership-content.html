<!-- High School Changemakers -->
<p id="catalyst-intro">Clematis Catalyst Scholars Program empowers high school students with promising, impactful ideas for society 
    by providing mentorship to help bring these ideas to life. Catalyst Scholars may be invited to apply for financial support up 
    to CAD $500 to scale their ideas.</p>

<!-- Why Catalyst Scholars -->
<p id="catalyst-why-intro">We believe that there are three essential ingredients to support the next generation of leaders:</p>

<p id="catalyst-mentorship">Mentorship: YOU will work closely with Clematis’ mentors and advisors from diverse backgrounds. 
    They are affiliated with institutions around the world, including Europe (e.g., University of Oxford, University of Cambridge, 
    Rhodes Trust, and Schmidt Science Fellows), North America (e.g., University of Toronto, Harvard University, UC Berkeley, 
    Princeton University), Africa (e.g., Covenant University), and additional institutions worldwide.</p>

<p id="catalyst-leadership">Leadership Development: YOU will receive structured support, including check-ins and progress reports, 
    from the Clematis Team. You will get an opportunity to showcase your work and attend talks from our distinguished mentors and 
    advisors. Our Founder, who’s a Rhodes Scholar @Oxford and full-ride Pearson scholar alum @UofT, will be delighted to witness 
    and support your journey!</p>

<p id="catalyst-financial">Financial Support: Contingent on progress, Catalyst Scholars get an opportunity to apply for our 
    Catalyst Grant, aimed to support impactful projects led by high school students, with budgets of up to CAD $250-$500 for 
    each project.</p>
