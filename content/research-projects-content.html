<!-- Description Text -->
 <p id="des-text">Hands-on research projects are ongoing research projects led by our faculty partners and/or graduate student 
    researchers from the University of Toronto and the University of Oxford. In collaboration with pedagogical experts, 
    we have worked with faculty and project leads to welcome students from around the world at all skill levels, from high 
    school to recent graduates!  </p>

<!-- What's the Cost -->
 <p id="cost-text">Itâ€™s free! Clematis, in collaboration with our partners, also provide in-kind research support, 
    including research tools/materials, and publication fees typically required for submitting to academic journals. 
    In other words, students will never be asked to pay.  </p>

<!-- Tools and Methodologies -->
 <p id="tools-text">Our programs are open to students around the world at all skill levels, from high school to recent graduates. 
    Our students have been engaged with a wide range of research methodologies and tools, including Covidence for systematic 
    reviews, programming languages like R and Python for data analysis, and a variety of statistical techniques such as 
    parametric and non-parametric tests, regressions, structural equation modelling, and multivariate statistics. 
    Many have also explored machine learning approaches, including random forest, XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, support vector 
    machines, and natural language processing, as well as qualitative methods like thematic and content analysis. </p>

<!-- Matching -->
 <p id="match-text">Students are matched to the ongoing research projects based on their research interest and current skill levels. 
    We ask students to fill out the research interest form, and as long as they provide a complete application, they will be invited 
    for an interview when there are new availabilities on a first come, first served basis.  </p>

<!-- Acceptances -->
 <p id="accept">Aligning with our mission to make research opportunities accessible to everyone, we have accepted every student, 
    regardless of their skill levels, into our program on a first come, first served basis, as long as the students feel that the 
    research projects align with their learning goals.</p>
