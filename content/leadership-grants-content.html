</p>

<!-- Education -->
<p id="grant-area-education-title">1. Education</p>
<p id="grant-area-education-desc">
Education is a powerful catalyst for individual and societal transformation. It fosters critical thinking, 
creativity, and problem-solving, equipping learners with the skills to navigate an ever-changing world. 
Ensuring inclusive, equitable, and quality education for all is essential in breaking cycles of poverty, 
reducing inequalities, and empowering communities. Beyond academics, education nurtures curiosity, resilience, 
and a sense of agency, enabling individuals to contribute meaningfully to society. We welcome projects that 
tackle aspects of education, including educational equity, STEM education, literacy/numeracy, digital literacy 
and access to technology, education infrastructure, schooling experience, skills-based education, 
culturally-relevant and multilingual education, early childhood education, and special education.
</p>

<!-- Healthcare -->
<p id="grant-area-health-title">2. Healthcare</p>
<p id="grant-area-health-desc">
Healthcare remains one of the most pressing global challenges, with billions of people lacking essential 
health services coverage, facing financial barriers to treatment, or suffering from preventable diseases. 
Inequities in healthcare disproportionately impact marginalized communities, widening social and economic disparities. 
Investing in healthcare solutions—whether through improving access, advancing medical innovation, 
strengthening public health systems, or addressing social determinants—can save lives, reduce suffering, 
and create more resilient societies. We welcome projects that tackle aspects of healthcare, including health equity, 
primary and preventive healthcare, mental health and well-being, public and global health, maternal and child health, 
chronic and infectious disease, nutrition, ageing, reproductive and sexual health, telemedicine and digital health, 
social determinants of health, and Indigenous and culturally competent healthcare.
</p>

<p id="grant-area-climate-desc">
Climate change, environmental degradation, and unsustainable practices pose some of the greatest threats 
to human health, biodiversity, and global stability. Addressing these challenges requires urgent action to reduce 
carbon emissions, protect ecosystems, and develop sustainable solutions that balance economic growth with 
environmental responsibility. We welcome projects that tackle various aspects of climate change, environmental challenges, 
and sustainability, including climate change mitigation, climate adaptation and resilience, renewable energy, 
sustainable agriculture, food security, conservation and biodiversity protection, waste management, urban sustainability, 
Indigenous ecological knowledge, sustainable enterprise, pollution, climate policy, climate activism, 
environmental justice, and environmental health.

<p id="grant-area-culture-desc">
Cultural heritage, creativity, and expression are fundamental to the identity, history, and diversity of societies worldwide. 
Preserving traditions, languages, art forms, and historical narratives connects generations, fosters understanding, 
and promotes cultural pride. We welcome projects that celebrate and preserve cultural heritage, creativity, 
and expression, including cultural heritage, language and literary preservation, artistic innovation, 
public arts, music and dance, craftsmanship, traditional knowledge systems, Indigenous cultures, festivals, 
museums, cultural tourism, education/events related to cultures and arts, identity and self-expression,

The rapid advancement of technology brings both innovation and profound ethical dilemmas. Cybersecurity and 
digital governance are essential in protecting privacy, preventing misinformation, and ensuring technology serves
