    students to bring their ideas to life. Catalyst Scholars may be invited to apply for financial support up to CAD $500 to 
    scale their ideas.</p>

<!-- Multi-Tiered Mentorship -->
<p id="mentorship-intro">The Catalyst Scholars Program offers a scaffolded support system that pairs you with mentors at three distinct 
    levels—each bringing a unique perspective to fuel your growth, innovation, and impact.</p>

<p id="mentorship-peer">An accomplished undergraduate who will be your sounding board and guide.</p>
<p id="mentorship-senior">An exceptional graduate student leader who will provide specialized expertise and advice.</p>
<p id="mentorship-advisor">As you advance through the program, you may have the opportunity to meet with advisors—esteemed 
    scientists, leaders, founders, and professionals—who can inspire you as a young changemaker and offer lifelong connections.</p>

<!-- Application Process -->
<p id="application-intro">The Clematis Catalyst Scholars Program operates on a rolling basis, meaning you may start your application at 
    any time throughout the year! Clematis Discord will be our primary platform for communication and collaboration.</p>
<p id="application-stages">The application process is in three stages:</p>

<p id="stage1-part1">Introduce yourself, your passion, and your vision to create positive impact. Share your story in a format that 
    best represents you—this could be a video (or series of videos), images, infographics, carousel posts, creative visual formats, 
    or other creative approaches on Discord.</p>
<p id="stage1-part2">Share the idea or project you would love to bring to life. You can present it through videos, written content, 
    mind maps, charts, infographics, or any other engaging format on Discord.</p>
<p id="stage1-monthly">Monthly Progress Updates. Share progress updates about your project to the Clematis Discord community. 
    Your updates can be in a format that best suits your communication style, such as a video (or series of videos) or a 
    written submission. Include a brief description of your project, steps you have taken toward your goals, what you hope to 
    accomplish next, and reflections on your learning.</p>
<p id="stage1-week12">Google Form Submission. Submit our Google Form and confirm the completion of the application requirements above. 
    Email clematis.reh@gmail.com that you have submitted the form.</p>
<p id="stage1-timeline">The timeline for each submission is flexible. However, all components should be completed within three 
    months from your Initial Discord submission.</p>
<p id="stage1-format">We encourage you to choose a format that best represents your ideas and communication style such as videos, 
    written content, visual formats such as infographics, mind maps, charts, carousel posts, other creative approaches, or 
    combination of formats. Keep each component concise and complementary.</p>
<p id="stage1-video">For video content, you are welcome to post your material(s) on social media or cloud-sharing services, and 
    provide a link to your submission on Discord. Submissions posted elsewhere should indicate they are part of your Clematis 
    Catalyst Scholars application (#ClematisCatalyst). Summarize your videos with an engaging blurb for context.</p>

<p id="stage2-congrats">If you have reached this stage, congratulations! Completing this process shows your dedication to creating 
    change and commitment to making a difference. You’re already making an impact by sharing your vision with us and engaging with 
    peers.</p>
<p id="stage2-proposal">Semi-finalists will be invited to submit a formal proposal of your project. This proposal may be shared with 
    potential advisors, mentors, and interviewers, and may be used for considering future grants. Applicants submit the proposal using 
    the provided template within 30 days.</p>
<p id="stage2-finalists">Once semi-finalists submit the proposal, the adjudicators will select the finalists based on all application 
    materials, including the initial submission, monthly updates, and the formal proposal.</p>

<p id="stage3-intro">This is the final stage before becoming a Catalyst Scholar! Finalists will be invited for at least one interview.</p>
<p id="stage3-format">Interview Format and Notification: Introduction (5 mins). Finalists present their project and progress 
    (15 mins). The interviewer may ask follow-up questions (15-30 mins) and may include adjudicators, trustees, mentors, and advisors. 
    The interview will be recorded. Exceptional presentations may be highlighted on social media with consent.</p>
