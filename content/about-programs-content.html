<!-- Catalyst Scholars Program -->
<p id="catalyst-p1">We have launched the Clematis Catalyst Scholars Program to empower high school students with promising, 
    impactful ideas for society by providing mentorship to help bring these ideas to life. 
    Through our free six-month mentorship program, selected Scholars will receive one-on-one mentorship 
    from at least two distinguished mentors and advisors, including Rhodes Scholars, Pearson Scholars, scientists, 
    founders, and professionals from a wide range of fields.  
    
<p id="catalyst-p2">Contingent on their progress, Catalyst Scholars may be invited to apply for the 
    Clematis Catalyst Grant, offering up to $250-500 CAD for each project to scale up and drive real societal change. </p>

<!-- Research Projects -->
 <p id="research-p1">We partner with professors and graduate student researchers from the University of Toronto and the University of 
    Oxford to offer real, authentic research projects across 10+ disciplines completely free of charge to over 100 research 
    enthusiasts. Thanks to the support of our collaborators and grants, we also cover all publication fees typically required for 
    submitting to academic journals. </p>

 <p id="research-p2">Our programs are open to students around the world at all skill levels, from high school to recent graduates. 
    Our students have been engaged with a wide range of research methodologies and tools, including Covidence for systematic reviews, 
    programming languages like R and Python for data analysis, and a variety of statistical techniques such as parametric and 
    non-parametric tests, regressions, structural equation modelling, and multivariate statistics. Many have also explored machine 
    learning approaches, including random forest, XGBoost, k-Nearest Neighbors, support vector machines, and natural language 
    processing, as well as qualitative methods like thematic and content analysis. </p>

<!-- Fly Connectome -->
 <p id="fly-p1">We are excited to launch the 2025 Fly Connectome Research Competition, the first international competition of its kind, 
    designed to introduce high school and undergraduate students to the cutting-edge world of connectomics and neuroscience research 
    with‚ÄØCAD $500‚ÄØin total prizes.  </p>

 <p id="fly-p2">In partnership with Profs.‚ÄØGruntman's‚ÄØand‚ÄØAnreiter's‚ÄØLabs at the University of Toronto,‚ÄØwe‚Äôre thrilled to invite 
    students on a fun-filled journey into neuroscience, where you'll get hands-on experience with an‚ÄØopen-source, large-scale brain 
    dataset, guided by supportive, knowledgeable instructors throughout the research competition. Whether you're new to neuroscience 
    or already curious about the brain, this is your chance to dive in, explore, and discover! Our early submission deadline is August 
    31, 2025.</p>

<!-- Think Like a Physicist -->
 <p id="physicist-text">We have launched the Think Like a Physicist‚ÄîClematis Training Program‚Äîa hands-on introduction to physics 
    research led by PhD students from the University of Sydney and the University of Oxford! Over four engaging journal club sessions, 
    we explored distinct areas of physics: optical physics, biophysics, astroparticle physics, and photonics/plasmonics. Each session 
    offered an opportunity to dive into cutting-edge research papers, discuss complex concepts, and connect with a community of budding 
    physicists. We have recorded the sessions from which you can watch on our YouTube. Those who attend all sessions, either live or 
    asynchronously, and complete the required assignments via Discord will receive a certificate recognizing their participation and 
    effort. üåå ‚öõÔ∏è</p>
